\title{Calculate Rank-based Senescence Score (RSS)}
\usage{
calculate_rss(expr_matrix, up_genes_file = NULL, down_genes_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr_matrix}{A matrix of gene expression data (rows are genes, columns are samples).}

\item{up_genes_file}{A file path to the up-regulated senescence genes (rds format). Default is NULL, which uses built-in genes.}

\item{down_genes_file}{A file path to the down-regulated senescence genes (rds format). Default is NULL, which uses built-in genes.}
}
\value{
A data frame with sample names and corresponding normalized RSS values.
}
\description{
This function calculates a rank-based senescence score (RSS) for each sample based on the
expression levels of up-regulated and down-regulated senescence-related genes.
